While browsing Vim documentation I encountered a nice tip about how to get highlithing of user-defined types. I decided to extend it a little to also support types defined elsewhere, that the source file may use (i.e. included files).

The script is written in Python and also requires CPP preprocessor (tested with 3.3 and 3.4) as well as exuberant ctags program.
